## üìñ Introduction
We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time-series analysis. Pre-training large models on time-series data is challenging due to (1) the absence a large and cohesive public time-series repository, and (2) diverse time-series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in its nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time-series, called the Time-series Pile, and systematically tackle time-series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time-series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time-series models.

### MOMENT: One Model, Multiple Tasks, Datasets & Domains

</div>

MOMENT on different datasets and tasks, without any parameter updates:
- _Imputation:_ Better than statistical imputation baselines
- _Anomaly Detection:_ Second best $F_1$ than all baselines
- _Classification:_ More accurate than 11 / 16 compared methods
- _Short-horizon Forecasting:_ Better than ARIMA on some datasets

By linear probing (fine-tuning the final linear layer): 
- _Imputation:_ Better than baselines on 4 / 6 datasets
- _Anomaly Detection:_ Best $F_1$
- _Long-horizon Forecasting:_ Competitive in some settings

### MOMENT Captures the Language of Time Series
Principal components of the embeddings of synthetically generated sinusoids suggest that MOMENT can capture subtle trend, scale, frequency, and phase information. In each experiment, $c$ controls the factor of interest, for example the power of the trend polynomial $c \in [\frac{1}{8}, 8)$ (Oreshkin et al., 2020). We generate multiple sine waves by varying $c$, derive their sequence-level representations using MOMENT, and visualize them in a 2-dimensional space using PCA.

### MOMENT Learns Meaningful Representation of Data
PCA visualizations of representations learned by MOMENT on the [ECG5000](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ecg5000) dataset in UCR Classification Archive. Here different colors represent different classes. Even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, MOMENT learns distinct representations for different classes.

### Architecture in a Nutshell

A time series is broken into disjoint fixed-length sub-sequences called patches, and each patch is mapped into a D-dimensional patch embedding. During pre-training, we mask patches uniformly at random by replacing their patch embeddings using a special mask embedding `[MASK]`. The goal of pre-training is to learn patch embeddings which can be used to reconstruct the input time series using a light-weight reconstruction head.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

**Recommended Python Version:** Python 3.11 (support for additional versions is expected soon).

You can install the `momentfm` package using pip:
```bash
pip install momentfm
```
Alternatively, to install the latest version directly from the GitHub repository:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment.git
```

To load the pre-trained model for one of the tasks, use one of the following code snippets:

**Forecasting**
```python
from momentfm import MOMENTPipeline

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large", 
    model_kwargs={
        "task_name": "forecasting",
        "forecast_horizon": 96
    },
)
model.init()
```

**Classification**
```python
from momentfm import MOMENTPipeline

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large", 
    model_kwargs={
        "task_name": "classification",
        "n_channels": 1,
        "num_class": 2
    },
)
model.init()
```

**Anomaly Detection, Imputation, and Pre-training**
```python
from momentfm import MOMENTPipeline

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large", 
    model_kwargs={"task_name": "reconstruction"},
)
model.init()
```

**Representation Learning**
```python
from momentfm import MOMENTPipeline

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large", 
    model_kwargs={"task_name": "embedding"},
)
model.init()
```

## ‚õëÔ∏è Research Code
We designed this codebase to be extremely lightweight, and in the process removed a lot of code! We released the complete but messier research code [here](https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment-research). This includes code to handle different datasets, and scripts for pre-training, fine-tuning and evaluating MOMENT alongside other baselines. An early version of this code was available on [Anonymous Github](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BETT-773F/README.md).
